Evaluation Metrics for RAG Systems

Evaluating RAG systems requires measuring both retrieval quality and generation quality:

Retrieval Metrics:
- Precision: What percentage of retrieved documents are relevant?
- Recall: What percentage of relevant documents were retrieved?
- MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank): Average of reciprocal ranks of first relevant document
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain): Considers ranking quality

Generation Metrics:
- Faithfulness: Is the answer derived only from the retrieved context?
- Answer Relevance: Does the answer actually address the question?
- Context Precision: How relevant are the retrieved documents?
- Context Recall: Are all relevant pieces of information in the retrieved context?

Tools like DeepEval and Ragas provide automated frameworks for computing these metrics, making it easier to compare different RAG approaches and track improvements over time.

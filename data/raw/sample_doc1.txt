Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a technique that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. The process works in three main steps:

1. Document Indexing: Documents are split into chunks and converted into vector embeddings using an embedding model. These embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient similarity search.

2. Query Processing: When a user asks a question, it is also converted into a vector embedding using the same embedding model.

3. Answer Generation: The most relevant document chunks are retrieved based on semantic similarity, and these chunks are provided as context to the language model to generate an accurate answer.

RAG is particularly useful for applications that need to answer questions based on specific, up-to-date, or private information that the language model wasn't trained on. It helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, grounded responses.
